DESCRIPTION

can be used to simplify operations of display controller and
provide them throw only one 16-bit register.
decodes 16 bit value from register to four values, according to the
inputs of display controller.

INPUTS

o   one 16-bit input, value from register. Bits 0-3 - X coordinate,
    bits 4-7 - Y coordinate, bit 8 - pixel state, bit 9 - write.

OUTPUTS

all according to the inputs of display-controller
o   X coord
o   Y coord
o   pixel state
o   write
Due to their locations on circuit, display decoder can be simply placed
next to the display controller (on the left side of it).
