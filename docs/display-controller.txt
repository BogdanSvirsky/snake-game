DESCRIPTION

this circuit is used to control 16x16 display per pixel.
It has it's own memory to store current state of display, every pixel.

INPUTS

o   X_coord - horisontal coordinate of pixel, number of column, 
    4-bit value
o   Y_coord - vertical coordinate of pixel, number of row, 
    4-bit value
o   pixel state - 1 bit value, describe how will change pixel, 
    selected by X_coord and Y_coord.
o   write - 1 bit, to store pixel state to selected pixel, need to 
    be raised from 0 to 1 (recommend then drop from 1 to 0 immediately)
o   pixel check - 1 bit, use to get information about this pixel 
    (with X Y coords), is it enabled or disabled.
o   game over - 1 bit, use to end the game and switch display to
    game over screen  

OUTPUTS

o   there are 16 16-bit outputs, display 16x16 can be easily placed
    on top of display controller.
o   checked - if pixel check enabled, gives info about pixel with 
    X Y coords, is it enabled or disabled.
