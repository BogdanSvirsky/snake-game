Consider A as the beginning of memory mapped address space. This space is
16 bytes length in memore (on processor's view) 
At the beginning of execution, processor should set A. To do this,
firstly r5 becomes equal to A, that will be installed, and then bit 3 on r6 should be
taked from 0 to 1.

register r6 is used as output to control 0 parts of circuit
o   bit 0 - when switch from 1 to 0, new 16-bit random value is 
    generated on memory mapped input to A + 1. Random value is 8-bit length and
    can be used for random coordinates.
o   bit 1 - check collision is used to check is pixel with current
    coordinates on or not. Output goes to the A + 2 as 1 or 0.
o   bit 2 - game over, when 1, display switches to the 'game over' screen.
o   bit 3 - install beginning of memory mapped address space
