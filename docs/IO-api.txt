Consider A as the beginning of memory mapped address space. 
By now A = 0x8800
register r6 is used as output to control 0 parts of circuit
o   bit 0 - when switch from 1 to 0, new 16-bit random value is 
    generated on memory mapped input to A + 1. Random value is 8-bit length and
    can be used for random coordinates.
o   bit 1 - check collision is used to check is pixel with current
    coordinates on or not. Output goes to the A + 2 as 1 or 0.
o   bit 2 - game over, when 1, display switches to the 'game over' screen.
